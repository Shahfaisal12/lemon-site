      title: "why hire remote developers?",
      content: ` <p>during the last decade, the remote part of the it labor market has been constantly on the rise. internet speed is skyrocketing, net coverage is practically ubiquitous, and laptops are weightless. why should you stay in the inconvenient office when you can be just as productive on the beach? — think app developers. why should i rent an office when i can afford not to? — ponder startup owners. hence the trend.</p>
    <p>let’s now enumerate some clear benefits of remote software engineer jobs for employers and employees.</p> <p style="color: #c58fff">developers’ remote bonuses</p>
    <ul><li><span style="color:#FFFFFF">work-life balance.</span> it’s important to pursue this balance daily — to have time for coding and health, recreation, and recharging. long commute lines, traffic jams, and other uncomfortable daily work issues often boost depression development. when you suddenly realize 4 hours of your day get lost on the road, there’s a strong desire for a teleport to be invented. until it’s not, try remote.</li>
    <li><span style="color:#FFFFFF">autonomy.</span> as a rule, remote developers are autonomous and don’t have to report to bosses every working hour. results are the key to success, and discipline opens the way to good results.</li>
    <li><span style="color:#FFFFFF">time efficiency.</span> remote mode allows better time management and workflow organization.</li>
    <li><span style="color:#FFFFFF">productivity.</span> no distractions, micromanagement, petty water cooler conflicts — what’s not to like? these favorable conditions greatly boost the remote performance of devs for hire. unless you’re not tailored for unofficial work surroundings, that is.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: #c58fff">employers’ remote bonuses</p>

    <ul>
    <li><span style="color:#FFFFFF">cost sparing.</span> according to the latest research, startups can save up to 1000 dollars yearly on one remote worker. multiply that by the average company size.</li>
    <li><span style="color:#FFFFFF">work automatization.</span> when on the remote, you can’t avoid rationalization, digitalization, and automatization. if you handle it properly (conquer jira and agile, organize your documentation flow, etc.), your work will be much faster and more efficient.</li>
    <li><span style="color:#FFFFFF">talent pool access.</span> looking for developers to hire onsite, you’re strangled with geography. remote allows you to find free hands around the globe.</li>
    <li><span style="color:#FFFFFF">flexibility.</span> see above. no office, no strings attached; everyone works at their convenient time with some necessary overlaps.</li>
    <li><span style="color:#FFFFFF">happier and healthier employees.</span> they boost your company’s reputation and are more productive and committed to your startup (because you’re praising their productivity).</li>
    </ul>

        <p>
          the answer can vary depending on the hiring mode, client’s budget,
          geography, business type, and experience level of the developer in
          question, as well as other factors. if you need a middle or a senior
          remote dev with solid experience, it pays off to collaborate with
          vetting platforms like lemon.io, as the hiring process within such
          platforms can take up to a week (and that’s quite fast). we filter all
          the candidates and offer only specialists who’ve passed several
          vetting stages.

          sometimes, there’s just no chemistry between you and your contractor.
          however, if you hire developers with lemon.io, you’re lucky since all
          the unsatisfactory candidates will be substituted by the platform as
          soon as possible. you just need to claim your need for substitution to
          the customer success department — and wait for the new professional to
          catch up after the previous one. ps. detailed feedback about the
          unsatisfactory contractor will significantly ease finding a candidate
          more suitable for your needs.
